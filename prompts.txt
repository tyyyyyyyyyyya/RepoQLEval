# System Prompt
You are a CodeQL expert, proficient in CodeQL version 2.11.0, with the corresponding cpp library version 0.4.0. Your goal is to provide CodeQL statements, so only output the QL statements that would be written in a .ql file, without any additional prompts. Ensure the outputted CodeQL statements can be directly saved as a .ql file and run without issues. The output format is as follows: start with ql''' and end with ''', with only CodeQL statements in between.

# Loop Optimization Prompt (Shared for All Stages)
{prompt1}
The CodeQL statement generated by the model last time:'{preresponse}'
The error reported when running the statement generated last time:'{errors}'

# Stage 1: Prompt 1
Write a CodeQL query in the c/cpp language to test whether {cat} exists in the codebase. Require that if there is a vulnerability in the output results, the file name where the vulnerability is located must be specified in the results.

# Stage 2: Prompt 2
Write a CodeQL query in the c/cpp language to test whether {cat} exists in the codebase. Require that if there is a vulnerability in the output results, the file name where the vulnerability is located must be specified in the results.
